# Prodigy Infotech (Data Science)

**Duration**: 1 Month  
**Mode**: Project-Based Internship  
**Role**: Data Science Intern

## 📌 Overview

During this 1-month internship at Prodigy Infotech, I completed a set of structured data science projects using real-world datasets. The internship focused on improving data handling, visualization, and basic machine learning skills. Each project was designed to explore a unique domain with specific data-driven insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Applied:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization and pattern recognition
- Supervised ML (where applicable)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

## 📁 Projects Completed:

### 🚗 **Accident Dataset Analysis**
- Analyzed traffic accident patterns
- Identified high-risk zones and time-based trends

### 🏦 **Bank Dataset Analysis**
- Explored customer behavior and banking patterns
- Performed segmentation and EDA for financial features

### 👥 **Population Dataset Analysis**
- Visualized demographic trends and population growth
- Generated statistical summaries and region-based comparisons

### 🐦 **Twitter Sentiment Dataset**
- Performed text preprocessing on tweets
- Conducted sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative)
- Visualized word clouds and polarity trends

Each project enhanced my understanding of how to transform raw data into insights through visual storytelling and exploratory techniques.
