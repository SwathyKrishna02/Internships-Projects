# CodeAlpha – Data Science Internship

**Duration**: 1 Month  
**Role**: Data Science Intern  
**Internship Mode**: Project-Based  

## 📌 Overview
At CodeAlpha, I completed three key data science projects focused on experimental design, regression modeling, and time series forecasting. These projects helped me strengthen my skills in hypothesis testing, model building, and working with sequential data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning (LSTM)

## 💼 Projects Completed

### 🔍 A/B Testing (Statistical Experimentation)
- Conducted hypothesis testing to evaluate two marketing campaign variants.
- Used p-values, confidence intervals, and t-tests to measure significance.
- Interpreted business impact based on statistical outcomes.

### 📈 Predictive Analysis with Linear Regression
- Built a predictive model to estimate future trends based on historical data.
- Applied feature engineering, model training, and evaluation (R², RMSE).
- Visualized prediction outcomes and correlation heatmaps.

### 📉 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
- Developed a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- Preprocessed and normalized historical stock data for neural network input.
- Evaluated model performance and visualized future stock trend predictions.
