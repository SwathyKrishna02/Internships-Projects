**Duration**: 4 Weeks  
**Mode**: Project-based Internship  
**Type**: Independent Learning and Execution

## 📌 Overview

The CodSoft Internship was a structured, short-term program where participants were assigned real-world data science problems. The goal was to independently implement machine learning workflows, perform exploratory data analysis, and deliver meaningful insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Applied:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Model training, testing, and evaluation (classification and regression)
- Visualization and insight presentation

## 📁 Projects Completed:

### 🔹 **Iris Dataset Classification**
- Applied supervised ML (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree)
- Handled feature scaling and model comparison
- Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization

### 🔹 **IMDb Indian Movies Dataset Analysis**
- Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed ratings, genres, top actors, and box office trends
- Visualized patterns and trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Each project was submitted within a weekly deadline, simulating real-world project timelines and independent delivery responsibilities.
