# Restaurant Data Science Project â€“ Cognifyz Internship

**Internship Duration**: 1 Month  
**Internship Type**: Structured Weekly Learning  
**Focus Area**: Real-World Data Science Workflow on Restaurant Dataset  

This project was executed as part of a 4-week internship at CogniFive, where I worked progressively on a restaurant dataset, simulating real-time feature addition and client-based iterations. The work was divided into three learning levels:

---

## ðŸ§ª Level 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explored the dataset structure and content
- Handled missing values and performed data type conversions
- Conducted descriptive analysis to identify top-performing cuisines and popular cities

---

## ðŸ“Š Level 2: Table Booking, Online Delivery, and Price Range Analysis
- Analyzed restaurant features such as:
  - Table booking options
  - Online delivery services
  - Common price ranges
- Engineered new features to improve model performance
- Discovered trends and relationships within features


---

## ðŸ¤– Level 3: Predictive Modeling and Customer Preference Analysis
- Built regression models to **predict restaurant ratings**
- Analyzed **customer preferences** using categorical trends
- Visualized key insights using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps

---

Each level was designed to build upon the previous one, simulating a full-cycle data science project â€” from raw data to insights and predictive modeling.
