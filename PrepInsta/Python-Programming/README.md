**Type**: Hands-on Internship | Individual Projects

## 🔍 Overview

This 2-month internship provided a practical, project-based learning experience in Python programming. Weekly sessions were followed by guided project tasks, allowing me to develop a strong foundation in Python through real-world problem-solving and game-based projects.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used:
- Core Python (variables, loops, functions, OOP)
- File handling and logic building
- API integration & web scraping (using BeautifulSoup/requests)
- Basic web development (for final project)
- CLI-based game design and condition handling

- 🎮 **Guess the Number Game**  
- 🔠 **Hangman Game**  
- ☕ **Coffee Machine Simulation**  
- ♠️ **Blackjack Card Game**  
- ❓ **Online Quiz System**  
- 🌐 **Web Scraping Project** (e.g., product listings or job data)  
- 🎬 **Netflix UI Clone** *(Final Project)* – A simple static UI clone representing the Netflix landing page, showcasing beginner-level front-end skills using Python tools

All projects were implemented independently, with weekly classes to introduce concepts and doubt-clearing sessions as needed.
