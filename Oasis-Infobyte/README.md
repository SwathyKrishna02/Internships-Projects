## 💼 Projects Completed

### 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
- Built a regression model to predict car prices based on factors like mileage, brand, and fuel type.
- Applied techniques like feature scaling, encoding, and model evaluation using MAE/RMSE.

### 📧 Email Spam Detection
- Developed a machine learning classification model to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.
- Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF, and Naive Bayes classifier.

### 📊 Unemployment Analysis with Python
- Analyzed unemployment trends in India using publicly available datasets.
- Performed EDA and created insightful visualizations to interpret regional and temporal unemployment patterns.
